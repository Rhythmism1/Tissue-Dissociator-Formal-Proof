To install the software, you will need a microcontroller board that supports the Coq programming language. You can download the latest version of Coq from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

Once you have installed Coq, you can download the source code for the Tissue Dissociation Machine program from the GitHub repository. The source code is written in Coq and includes several modules that implement the various functions and data structures used by the software.

To compile the program, you can use the Coq compiler to generate an executable file. The executable file can then be uploaded to the microcontroller board and run on the machine.

Usage
The Tissue Dissociation Machine software provides a command-line interface for controlling the machine. The interface allows you to start and stop the machine, set the temperature and RPM, and monitor the status of the various components.
